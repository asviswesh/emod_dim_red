# Project Name

This project uses a Conda environment to manage dependencies. Below are the steps to set up the environment and get started.

## Setup Instructions

```bash
# 1. Clone the Repository

# First, clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository

# 2. Create the Conda Environment

# The environment.yml file contains all the necessary dependencies to run this project. 
# To create the environment, use the following command:
conda env create -f environment.yml

# This will create a Conda environment with all the specified dependencies.

# 3. Activate the Environment

# After the environment is created, activate it using:
conda activate my-environment-name

# Make sure to replace `my-environment-name` with the name of the environment specified 
# in the `environment.yml` file (or any name you provided during the environment creation).

# 4. Update the Environment (Optional)

# If the `environment.yml` file has changed and you need to update your environment, run:
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune

# This will update the environment based on the latest `environment.yml` file and remove 
# any dependencies that are no longer required.

# 5. Deactivate the Environment

# Once you are done, you can deactivate the Conda environment using:
conda deactivate
